    ░▒▓ pentesting-cookbook ▓▒░ A set of recipes useful in fast-paced pentesting / red teaming scenarios

## Description

    ╭───────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
    │ Snippets, code samples and hints used in penetration  │░
    │ tests stored in a single repository so it can be      │░
    │ quickly accessed and searched during assessments.     │░
    │ Some of these were collected around the Web, some     │░
    │ developed. Feel free to contribute!                   │░

## Notes

* Since this handbook was not originally intended to be shared some parts may miss their original sources. I'll do my best to give proper credits and I hope you can help me with that.
* Formatting may seem quite exotic at first but this is the way I prefer to read. Thanks to indentation I can instantly see hierarchy and quickly scan interesting sections.
* This documentation structure gives best results with quick open, multi-line editing and full-text search options available in some popular text editors (like Sublime Text or VS Code).

## Structure

- `bin` Handy utilities to be run locally
- `bootstrap` Scripts for setting up local environment
- `snippets` All things useful to be run remotely

## Bootstraping scripts

Fast and easy way to set up a hardened pentesting environment (currently Kali only) both for x86 and arm (Raspberry PI):

    $ cd bootstrap
    $ sudo USERNAME=user ./run.kali.x86.sh

More information in `bootstrap/README.md`.

## Formatting / structure rules

* If there are more than three levels of hierarchy the file needs to be split.
* Sources (scripts) are located in the `snippets` directory (referenced by `@`).
* Conventions:
    * `~` commands
    * `@` file references
    * `-` lists
    * `#` comments (above)
    * OS specific commands:
        * `~$` (Linux)
        * `~#` (Linux - root required)
        * `~>` (Windows)
    * Shell specific commands:
        * `~PS>` (Powershell)
* Variables:
    * `VAR_ATTACKER_HOST`
    * `VAR_ATTACKER_PORT`
    * `VAR_TARGET_DOMAIN`
    * `VAR_TARGET_HOST`
    * `VAR_TARGET_PORT`
    * `VAR_TARGET_CIDR`
    * `VAR_TARGET_RANGE`
    * `VAR_USERNAME`
    * `VAR_PASSWORD`
    * `VAR_HASH`
    * `VAR_STRING`
    * `VAR_INTEGER`
    * `VAR_HEX`
    * `VAR_WORDLIST`
    * `VAR_*_HOST` (`VAR_FTP_HOST`, `VAR_ZOMBIE_HOST`, `VAR_PROXY_HOST` etc)
