# pentesting-cookbook

> A set of recipes useful in pentesting and red teaming scenarios

Snippets, code samples and hints used in penetration tests stored in a single repository so it can be quickly accessed and searched during the assessments.   

## Structure

- `bin` Handy utilities to be run locally
- `snippets` All things useful to be run remotely, code snippets, examples etc
- `Notes.*` All sort of helpers, lists and notes not necessarily related to specific service or stage
- `Target.Host.OS.*` - Things that can be done once foothold is established
- `Target.Host.Service.*` - Commands useful in enumeration and exploitation of particular service
- `Target.Network.*` - Commands related to scanning and moving around networks
- `Target.Recon.*` - Typical recon like DNS enumeration, OSINT etc.

## Formatting rules

* If there are more than three levels of hierarchy the file needs to be split.
* Sources (scripts) are located in the `snippets` directory (referenced by `@`).
* Conventions:
    * `~` commands
    * `@` file references
    * `-` lists
    * `--` comments (above the commented line)
    * OS specific commands:
        * `~$` (Linux, defaults to Bash)
        * `~#` (Linux - root required)
        * `~>` (Windows)
    * Shell specific commands:
        * `~PS>` (Powershell)
* Variables:
    * `VAR_ATTACKER_HOST`
    * `VAR_ATTACKER_PORT`
    * `VAR_TARGET_DOMAIN`
    * `VAR_TARGET_HOST`
    * `VAR_TARGET_PORT`
    * `VAR_TARGET_CIDR`
    * `VAR_TARGET_RANGE`
    * `VAR_TARGET_FILE`
    * `VAR_USERNAME`
    * `VAR_PASSWORD`
    * `VAR_HASH`
    * `VAR_STRING`
    * `VAR_INTEGER`
    * `VAR_HEX`
    * `VAR_WORDLIST`
    * `VAR_*_HOST` (`VAR_FTP_HOST`, `VAR_ZOMBIE_HOST`, `VAR_PROXY_HOST` etc)
