## Repositories and Tools

### [CMSeeK](https://github.com/Tuhinshubhra/CMSeeK)
* Basic CMS Detection of over 170 CMS
* Drupal version detection
* Advanced Wordpress Scans - Detects Version, User Enumeration, Plugins Enumeration, Theme Enumeration, Detects Users (3 Detection Methods), Looks for Version Vulnerabilities and much more!
* Advanced Joomla Scans - Version detection, Backup files finder, Admin page finder, Core vulnerabilit detection, Directory listing check, Config leak detection, Various other checks
* Modular bruteforce system - Use pre made bruteforce modules or create your own and integrate with it

### [windapsearch](https://github.com/ropnop/windapsearch)
`windapsearch` is a Python script to help enumerate users, groups and computers from a Windows domain through LDAP queries. By default, Windows Domain Controllers support basic LDAP operations through port 389/tcp. With any valid domain account (regardless of privileges), it is possible to perform LDAP queries against a domain controller for any AD related information.

### [Cyberchef](https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef)
CyberChef is a simple, intuitive web app for carrying out all manner of "cyber" operations within a web browser. These operations include simple encoding like XOR or Base64, more complex encryption like AES, DES and Blowfish, creating binary and hexdumps, compression and decompression of data, calculating hashes and checksums, IPv6 and X.509 parsing, changing character encodings, and much more.

### [LinEnum](https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum)
Scripted Local Linux Enumeration & Privilege Escalation Checks

### [Powerless](https://github.com/M4ximuss/Powerless)
A Windows privilege escalation (enumeration) script designed with OSCP labs (i.e. legacy Windows machines without Powershell) in mind. The script represents a conglomeration of various privilege escalation checks, gathered from various sources, all done via native Windows binaries present in almost every version of Windows.

### [Linux-Exploit-Suggester-2](https://github.com/jondonas/linux-exploit-suggester-2)
Next-generation exploit suggester based on Linux_Exploit_Suggester.  This script is extremely useful for quickly finding privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
* More exploits! (Last updated: March 27, 2019)
* Option to download exploit code directly from Exploit DB
* Accurate wildcard matching. This expands the scope of searchable exploits.
* Output colorization for easy viewing.

### [unix-privesc-check](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/unix-privesc-check)
Shell script to check for simple privilege escalation vectors on Unix systems

Unix-privesc-checker is a script that runs on Unix systems (tested on Solaris 9, HPUX 11, Various Linuxes, FreeBSD 6.2). It tries to find misconfigurations that could allow local unprivileged users to escalate privileges to other users or to access local apps (e.g. databases).

It is written as a single shell script so it can be easily uploaded and run (as opposed to un-tarred, compiled and installed). It can run either as a normal user or as root (obviously it does a better job when running as root because it can read more files).

### [SUID3NUM](https://github.com/Anon-Exploiter/SUID3NUM)
A standalone script supporting both python2 & python3 to find out all SUID binaries in machines/CTFs and do the following:
* List all Default SUID Binaries (which ship with linux/aren't exploitable)
* List all Custom Binaries (which don't ship with packages/vanilla installation)
* List all custom binaries found in GTFO Bin's (This is where things get interesting)
* Try and exploit found custom SUID binaries which won't impact machine's files


### [tcpforward](https://github.com/acg/tcpforward)
tcpforward is a userspace TCP connection forwarder. It uses efficient non-blocking I/O and is protocol agnostic.  Some uses include:
* Making remote services look like local ones
* Offering a service on a different port number without restarting it
* Allowing a non-root user to bind to a selected low port
* Tunneling connections into NAT'ed networks or past firewalls
* Evenly distributing a service-oriented architecture
* Monitoring a service's network usage

### [Invoke-Obfuscation](https://github.com/danielbohannon/Invoke-Obfuscation)
Invoke-Obfuscation is a PowerShell v2.0+ compatible PowerShell command and script obfuscator.

### [brutas](https://github.com/tasooshi/brutas)
Custom repository of Wordlists and passwords.

### [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings)
A list of useful payloads and bypass for Web Application Security and Pentest/CTF

### [SysInternals Suite](https://download.sysinternals.com/files/SysinternalsSuite.zip) 
The SysInternals suite of tools is a set of Windows applications that can be downloaded for free from their section of the Microsoft Technet web site. They are all portable, which means that not only do you not have to install them, you can stick them on a flash drive and use them from any PC.

### [SysInternals Live](https://live.sysinternals.com/)
Sysinternals Live is a service that enables you to execute Sysinternals tools directly from the Web without hunting for and manually downloading them. Simply enter a tool's Sysinternals Live path into Windows Explorer or a command prompt as `live.sysinternals.com/<toolname>` or  `\\live.sysinternals.com\tools\<toolname>`.
